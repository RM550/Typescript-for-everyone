# 📌 Getting Started with TypeScript 🚀

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on getting started with **TypeScript**! 🎯 In this document, we will go through the installation process, setup, and basic usage of TypeScript, using **Node Package Manager (NPM)**. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you set up your environment efficiently. Let's dive in! 💡

---

## 🎯 What is TypeScript? 🤔

**TypeScript** is a strongly typed programming language that builds on **JavaScript**, adding static type definitions. It provides better tooling, improved maintainability, and enhanced developer experience. TypeScript is developed and maintained by **Microsoft** and is widely used for building scalable web applications. 🏗️

### 🔥 Key Features of TypeScript:
✅ **Static Typing** – Helps in catching errors at compile time.
✅ **OOP Support** – Supports Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
✅ **Advanced IDE Support** – Works well with **VS Code** and other editors.
✅ **JavaScript Superset** – Any JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.
✅ **Better Code Readability & Maintainability** – Makes large-scale applications manageable.

## 📥 Installing TypeScript 🎯

Before we start using TypeScript, we need to install it. Follow the steps below to set up TypeScript on your machine. 🖥️

### 1️⃣ Install **Node.js** & **NPM**
TypeScript is installed using **NPM (Node Package Manager)**. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, follow these steps:

🔹 Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) 🌍
🔹 Download and install the latest **LTS** version of Node.js.
🔹 Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
node -v  # Check Node.js version
npm -v   # Check NPM version
```

If both commands return a version number, congratulations! 🎉 You have successfully installed Node.js and NPM. 🚀

---

### 2️⃣ Install TypeScript Compiler
Now, let’s install the **TypeScript Compiler (tsc)** globally on your machine:

```sh
npm install -g typescript
```

To verify the installation, run:

```sh
tsc -v
```

This command should output the installed **TypeScript version**, like:

```sh
Version 4.6.3
```

Great! 🎊 Now, TypeScript is successfully installed. Let's move to the next step.

## 🔧 Setting Up a TypeScript Project 📂

Once TypeScript is installed, we need to create a project and configure it properly. Follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Create a New Project Directory

```sh
mkdir typescript-project && cd typescript-project
```

### 2️⃣ Initialize a TypeScript Project

Run the following command to create a **tsconfig.json** file, which stores TypeScript configurations:

```sh
tsc --init
```

A `tsconfig.json` file will be generated. This file helps TypeScript understand how to compile your code.

### 3️⃣ Writing Your First TypeScript Code

Let's create a **sample TypeScript file**:

```sh
mkdir src && cd src
touch index.ts
```

Open `index.ts` in **VS Code** and write the following TypeScript code:

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to TypeScript 🚀`;
}

console.log(greet("Reyan"));
```

### 4️⃣ Compiling TypeScript Code 🏗️

TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be executed. Run the following command to compile `index.ts` into `index.js`:

```sh
tsc src/index.ts
```

After running this command, a new file `index.js` will be created inside the `src/` directory.

### 5️⃣ Running the Compiled JavaScript Code

Now, run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js:

```sh
node src/index.js
```

You should see the following output:

```sh
Hello, Reyan! Welcome to TypeScript 🚀
```

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully written and executed your first TypeScript program.

## 📌 Understanding the Code 🧐

Let’s break down our TypeScript code:

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to TypeScript 🚀`;
}

console.log(greet("Reyan"));
```

### 📜 Explanation:
1️⃣ **Function Definition** – We define a function `greet()` that takes a parameter `name` of type `string`.
2️⃣ **Return Type** – The function returns a `string`.
3️⃣ **Template Literals** – We use backticks (`` ` ``) to format the output message.
4️⃣ **Function Call** – We call `greet("Reyan")` and print the result to the console.

This example demonstrates **TypeScript's static typing** and **string interpolation**.
